   <h1>About this tool</h1>
   <p> This tool is meant for all types of relationships: platonic, familial, business, romantic, sexual, etc. </p>
   <p> It is meant to challenge and make clear exactly what we mean when we are using these descriptors. * </p>
   <p> To form your relationship, you and another can pick any number of “items” from the “menu”. </p>
   <h3> The “dish” that the two (or more) of you hold is your relationship. </h3>
   <p> By being open about your hopes and consciously agreeing together on what is in your relationship, </p>
   you can avoid conflict and disappointment later. No sneaking in items without the other knowing! 
   <h3>The things on your mutual plate can change at any time.</h3>
   <h3> Come back often and re-evaluate. Embrace your changing tastes and desires! </h3>
   <p>The menu is loosely sorted from less personal to intimate.</p>
